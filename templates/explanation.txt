dj-rest-auth uses by default below to verify email addresses of newly registered users

re_path(
        r"^dj-rest-auth/registration/account-confirm-email/(?P<key>[-:\w]+)/",
            VerifyEmailView.as_view(),
        name="account_confirm_email",


This requires a front end / manual copy of a token/key from the url. To avoid that I implemented the dj-allauth solution
with ConfirmEmailView and ACCOUNT_CONFIRM_EMAIL_ON_GET = True. Conseuqently clicking on the link in the email is enough to confirm.

After this implementation emails were getting confirmed but the redirect did not work as the template on the browsable api was directing to
a template that was non existent on the project. [templates/account/base.html]

I created this directory/template and put the % url api_root % to fix the problem
